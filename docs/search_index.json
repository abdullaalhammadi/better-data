Due to this, the availability of data has increased significantly. “There are 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created every day— which is why you need IBM Cloud Object Storage” — an IBM Advertisement. That is indeed an impressively large amount of data, but the IBM Cloud Object Storage is not actually needed because it is very likely that most of the data is probably random back-end logs or cat videos. In any case, most of the data available may not be useful, usable data. This document will go through the importance of developing standards and criteria for the processes of gathering, entering, and handling of data for the purpose of developing high quality datasets to provide valuable and beneficial results.
