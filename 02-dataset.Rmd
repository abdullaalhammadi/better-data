# The Dataset

## Why this dataset?

I chose this data set specifically because it covers most of the ideas that I will bring up. Do note that this dataset is **not** a cherry-picked one, but it offers a lot to work with. This dataset provides a wide variety of types of observations (date and time, geographical data, nominal data, ordinal data, etc.) as well as a lot of room for improvement and utilization.

## What will be covered?

The ideas that will be covered are: 

- The 4 "key" aspects of data, which are: 
    - Relevance
    - Reliability
    - Coverage
    - Consistency
- Setting the right standards
- Making the most of what is available
- Maximizing the effectiveness of data

These are not the definitive and final points that make or break datasets, but more of a general guideline of best practices and a grasp of positive thought process when working with such tasks. In the coming chapters, I will go further into detail regarding the ideas listed above.
